This blog will contain my thoughts and philosophies as I travel through this crazy thing we all call life. It's mainly a record for myself to look back on, but you're certainly welcome to bare witness to the journey.

This blog was created using [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Check it out! It's very lightweight and easy to set up if you have any kind of web development background.
