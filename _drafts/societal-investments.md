Healthcare, education, housing, energy, prison reform, UBI, space exploration.

**Healthcare** - Single payer system. Saving lives, and saving money. [Lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(19)33019-3/fulltext).

**Space Exploration** - Tons of inspiration to people among all facets, but also incredibly commercially viable products. [JPL](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/infographics/infographic.view.php?id=11358). [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_spinoff_technologies).

_Beauty and Happiness_

Societal investments strongly compare to personal investments. Diet, exercise, meditation, really any good habits, can be extremely painful in the beginning. But over time, the pay off is worth it. (Irony with me. Trying to take this into account in my own life.) Bad habits are generally great in the short term - eating something sweet, being lazy, etc. But offer poor outcomes in the long term. Is this the same with societal investments?
